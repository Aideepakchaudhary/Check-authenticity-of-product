# Check Authenticity of a Product
Only manufacturing unit will allow to add all the hash of the product..
 Check if hash is found in the storage that means the product is authentic.
 Should have mechanism to add manufacturing unit
 Need to think..if a product is used then do we need to delete the product from the chain?
 Anybody can see the barcode on the product and try to copy that barcode and put on the fake product?

### Conditions
